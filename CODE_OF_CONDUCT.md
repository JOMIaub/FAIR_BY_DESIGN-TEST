# Code of Conduct for Jona Mikkelsen’s FAIR-by-Design Learning Projects

## Our Pledge

As a contributor and maintainer of open learning projects under this account,  
I pledge to make participation a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free experience  
for everyone — regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability,  
ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level,  
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,  
or sexual identity and orientation.

These projects are built on openness, collaboration, and the FAIR-by-Design principles:  
**Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable**.  
Everyone engaging with this work is expected to act in a way that supports those values.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive and collaborative environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy, patience, and kindness toward others  
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints, disciplines, and experiences  
* Giving and accepting constructive feedback gracefully  
* Taking responsibility and learning from mistakes  
* Focusing on what is best for the learning community and the open-source ecosystem

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, or sexual attention of any kind  
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments  
* Public or private harassment or intimidation  
* Publishing private information (such as personal contact details) without consent  
* Conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or educational context

## Enforcement Responsibilities

As the sole maintainer of these projects,  
I am responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards.  
Inappropriate, threatening, or offensive contributions (such as comments, commits, or pull requests)  
may be edited, removed, or rejected.  
Where appropriate, I will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces,  
including GitHub repositories, issues, discussions, pull requests, and linked platforms,  
as well as when representing these projects in public settings  
(e.g. conference presentations, online events, or social media posts).
